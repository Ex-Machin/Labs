Run a programm

```
npm install -g typescript
tsc [numer laboratoirum]/[numer zadanie]
node [numer laboratoirum]/[numer zadanie]
```

for example:

```
tsc 1/4 && node 1/4
```

opens fourth task from first lab

Task 3 from fourth lab is not working and I don't know why (hours've been spent - 7);

Mayby you will need to install also node js - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
